 My solutions to some of the exercixes of "Think java, 7th edition"

1. Create a new program named Date.java. Copy or type in something like the Hello World program and make sure you can compile and run it.

2. Following the example in Section 2.4, write a program that creates variables named day, date, month, and year. The variable day will contain the day of the week (like Friday), and date will contain the day of the month (like the 13th). Assign values to those variables that represent todayâ€™s date.32 Chapter 2 Variables and Operators.

3. Display the value of each variable on a line by itself. This is an intermediate step that is useful for checking that everything is working so far.
Compile and run your program before moving on.


4. Modify the program so that it displays the date in standard American format; for example: Thursday, July 18, 2019.

5. Make the program calculate and display the number of seconds since
midnight.

6. Calculate and display the percentage of the day that has passed. You
might run into problems when computing percentages with integers, so
consider using floating-point.
